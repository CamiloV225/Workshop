# Workshop
### Summary
This Git repository hosts the initial development stage of my ETL workshop. Here, you'll discover the outcomes of my analysis performed on the candidates.csv dataset. This dataset contains valuable information about interviewees, encompassing their skill sets and interview details for various job applications.

Moreover, i've included a Jupyter Notebook that contains SQL queries designed for interaction with a PostgreSQL database. These queries have been thoughtfully crafted to retrieve specific insights and information from the database. To make things even more user-friendly, i've provided clear explanations alongside the queries, ensuring a smoother grasp of their purpose and functionality.
