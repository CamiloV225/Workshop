# Workshop

## Summary

This repository contains the development and analysis performed on the `candidates.csv` dataset. The dataset contains valuable information about interviewees, encompassing their skill sets and interview details for various job applications. This workshop evaluates your data management skills and your ability to create meaningful visualizations.

The workshop is divided into the following sections:

### Data Exploration

This section explores the dataset to get a better understanding of the data. This includes descriptive statistics, data cleaning, and data wrangling.

### Data Analysis

This section uses SQL queries to analyze the data and answer specific questions. The queries are documented in a Jupyter Notebook, which also provides clear explanations of the results.

### Data Visualization

This section uses visualizations to communicate the results of the data analysis. The visualizations are created using Python and the Matplotlib library.

## Tools Used

- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Data Analysis Language:** SQL
- **Data Visualization:** Python, Matplotlib

## How to Use This Repository

To use this repository, first you will need to have the following software installed:

- PostgreSQL
- Python 3.10
- Jupyter Notebook

Then you will need to download the repository and install the libraries needed to run the code:

1. You can clone the repository with this command: `git clone https://github.com/VinkeArtunduaga/workshop_01.git`
2. After that, you can install the following libraries that we will need to run the code:
   - Psycopg2: is the library that allows us to connect our code with Postgres, here you need to use the credentials in order to access the database.
   - Pandas: it will be useful to create a dataframe for easy management.
   - Matplotlib: A useful library to do the graphical analysis.

Once you have the necessary software installed, you can clone the repository to your local machine. Then, open the Jupyter Notebook in the `data-analysis` directory. The notebook contains all of the SQL queries and visualizations for the workshop.

I hope this is what you are looking for. Let me know if you have any other questions.
